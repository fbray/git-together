# Git Together - 8-24-2017

This repo will be the starting point for our demo at the Git Together presentation.

We will aim to demonstrate working with Git in a team, utilizing the command line
and GUI solutions.

# The gameplan

* We'll be building a very basic HTML document with some attached CSS.
* We will demonstrate making a change to the code, committing the change, pushing it to GitHub, making a PR, and merging the PR 
* Along the way, we'll touch on concepts of:
  * Branching
  * Push and Pull
  * Conflicts
